# -IPL Match Outcome Prediction using MachineLearning-
**Description:**
Developed a machine learning model to analyze and predict outcomes of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using historical match data.

**Key Responsibilities & Highlights:**

Performed data cleaning and feature engineering by removing irrelevant fields such as date, striker, and non-striker.

Used libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

Applied label encoding and normalization for categorical and numerical features.

Utilized deep learning frameworks (Keras, TensorFlow) for building and training predictive models.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations in the match dataset.

**Technologies Used:**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Keras, TensorFlow
